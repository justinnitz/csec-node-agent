# The New Relic Security Agent for Node.js is in preview and licensed under the New Relic Pre-Release Software Notice.

#### Repo: https://github.com/newrelic/csec-node-agent
#### Package Name: @newrelic/security-agent

The New Relic security agent is in preview and is not generally available.This module enables instrumentation of Node.js application for interactive application security analysis (IAST) and exposes exploitable vulnerabilities. 
The IAST capability should only be used in pre-production environments as the application is tested for real exploitable vulnerabilities.


## Installation and Getting Started

Typically, most users use the version auto-installed by the APM agent. You can see agent install instructions [here](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic#installation-and-getting-started).

In some cases, installing a specific version is ideal. For example, new features or major changes might be released via a major version update to this module, prior to inclusion in the main New Relic Node.js Agent.

```
npm install @newrelic/security-agent
```

```js
// index.js
const  newrelic = require(‘newrelic’);
require(‘@newrelic/security-agent’).start(newrelic);
```

For more information, please see the agent [installation guide][3].

The @newrelic/security-agent must be explicitly enabled in order to perform IAST analysis of the application. In the newrelic.js, set the following parameters
```
 /**
  * Security Configurations
  */
   security: {
    /**
      * To completely disable security, set agent.enabled flag to false. If the flag is set to false, the security module is not loaded. This property is read only once at application start.
      */
    agent: {
      enabled: true
    },
    /**
     * enables/disables security agent functions and generation of events.
     */
    enabled: true,
    
/**
     *  Security agent provides two modes: IAST and RASP. Default is IAST.
     */
    mode: 'IAST',
    /**
     * Security agent validator URL. Must be prefixed with wss://.
     */
    validator_service_url: 'wss://csec.nr-data.net',
  }
```
## Getting Started
